### ‚úÖ **Mitigation & ‚ÄúPath to Green‚Äù Plan**

| Step | Action                                                                                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | Escalate pending items formally via email or call to Calx / Ministry                                 |
| 2.   | Setup a checkpoint call **post July 15** regardless of update to force alignment                     |
| 3.   | Define a **revised project plan** including alternate dates / buffers                                |
| 4.   | Document the impact of each delayed item (UI lib, CMS, Maps) on delivery and share with stakeholders |
| 5.   | Prepare temporary fallback or mock solution for UI/CMS if feasible to continue work in parallel      |

### üîÅ **Next Steps for You**

* Coordinate with PM to list out the exact dependencies within UI, CMS, and Maps.
* Join the discussion with Calx team to drive clarity.
* Ask your lead if fallback options are technically possible to reduce idle time.
* Start preparing a tracker/log of all pending confirmations and updates for transparency.

Would you like me to help you **draft a follow-up mail** to stakeholders or create a **risk log** template for this?
