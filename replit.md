# Samiksha: A Trend Analysis Tool

## Overview

Samiksha is a modern web-based trend analysis tool designed for project management and tracking. It provides a digital dashboard for project managers to submit standardized weekly project status reports, track project health using RAG (Red, Amber, Green) status indicators, and leverage AI-powered analysis for risk identification and insights.

The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM, and integrates with AI/LLM services for automated project analysis.

## User Preferences

User: Samiksha (Portfolio Executive/Admin with full system access)
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Role: Admin with executive portfolio oversight capabilities

- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based access control with three user roles:
  - Project Manager: Can manage assigned projects and submit reports
  - Delivery Manager: Can view all projects and configure AI settings
  - Admin: Full system access
- Session-based authentication (simplified implementation)

### Project Management
- Project creation and management
- Project assignment to managers
- RAG status tracking (Red, Amber, Green)
- Customer and engagement type tracking

### Reporting System
- Weekly status report submission
- Technical review management
- Standardized forms with validation
- Historical report tracking

### AI Integration
- Configurable LLM providers (Google, OpenAI, DeepSeek)
- Automated project analysis and risk assessment
- Portfolio-level insights and trend analysis
- AI-generated status assessments

### Dashboard & Analytics
- Real-time project health overview
- Trend visualization with charts
- Statistics and metrics display
- AI-powered portfolio analysis header

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate and receive role-based access
2. **Project Setup**: Delivery managers create projects and assign project managers
3. **Report Submission**: Project managers submit weekly status reports through structured forms
4. **AI Analysis**: Configured LLM analyzes submissions and generates insights
5. **Dashboard Updates**: Real-time updates to dashboard showing project health and trends
6. **Analytics**: Historical data aggregation for trend analysis and reporting

## External Dependencies

### UI & Styling
- Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Lucide React for consistent iconography
- Chart.js integration for data visualization

### Data & State Management

## Deployment Strategy

- **Development**: Vite dev server with hot module replacement
- **Production Build**: Vite bundling for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Target Platform**: Designed for cloud deployment (5-day timeline requirement)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via environment variable configuration
- **Static Assets**: Served through Express with Vite integration in development

### Build Process
1. Frontend assets built with Vite to `dist/public`
2. Backend TypeScript compiled with esbuild to `dist/index.js`
3. Single deployment artifact with both frontend and backend
4. Environment-based configuration for database and AI services

### Environment Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- AI provider API keys for LLM integration
- Node.js environment detection for development/production modes
